    - ℹ Momofuku Ando founded a company *Nissin* in Ikeda, Osaka. He invented instant noodles in 1958 under brand name *Chikin Ramen*. In 1971, inspired by Americans breaking noodles in half and eating them from a paper cup after pouring hot water in, he invented *Cup Noodles* (カップヌードル, *Kappu Nūdoru*) — instant noodles sold in a foam cup.
